/** @file dfsdm.h
 * DFSDM microphone driver
 *
 * This module implements a simple 2-channels DFSDM microphone driver.
 *
 * The driver operates using DMA in circular mode, which means that while one
 * buffer is processed by the user's code, the other half is used by the DMA to
 * store the samples. This allows real time processing of the samples without
 * data loss. It is similar to what is done for the ADCs drivers by ChibiOS.
 *
 * This driver is tailored to the hardware present on the STM32F7 discovery
 * board, but the implementation should be relatively easy to adapt to another
 * target / use case.
